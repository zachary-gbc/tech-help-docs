# Adding Message Theme to ProPresenter
{: .no_toc }
This is for adding a new message theme to be used in a service like Sunday morning or special service like Good Friday, Thanksgiving Eve, etc.

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

# Pre-Notes and Assumptions:
- This assumes that the theme will follow the typical format of our messages and only includes instructions for the main slide types
- Artistic design of the theme slides will be needed to make them look good, but some overall snags and common pitfalls are explained here to help avoid them

# Creating the Theme
The first few steps are critical to be done in a specific order and before the syncronization script runs (otherwise you may have multiple themes)
1. Open Theme Editor
2. Under Theme Selector Choose New Theme at bottom and input the appropriate name
3. Open Finder and navigate to Documents > ProPresenter > Themes
4. Move the folder of the theme you just created into the Message Series folder
5. Back in ProPresenter you will now need to choose that them from the dropdown to continue editing

# Adding Slides
The first slide is always a blank slide. This has nothing on it and is useful for adding a new message.

## Points LT
The next slide is the Points LT slide. This one contains a textbox (usually on the bottom left) and is used for message points. Typically the background from the series is used as the textbox background. Sometimes it is scaled to fit or stretched to fill. Normally the textbox is made to be a lot bigger than the text it will contain and then the background expands to fit the text. 

To make the background expand to fit the text within the box go to the Text tab on the right side of the screen, using the gear dropdown add margin to the top, bottom, right and left sides (maybe 50 each to start), change the scaling to be "Container up or down", and then check the Lines Only checkbox. Change the dropdown to be Max Line Width and then adjust the vertical and horizontal padding to look good around the text within the box.

You should try a couple iterations of text in the box to see how it looks. Try a short one with just a couple words or a long point with multiple lines of text and make sure they all look good.

## Scripture / Quote
The next slide is the Scripture/Quote slide. The one contains the reference (or person being quoted), and the scripture or quote. This slide should be setup for the LED Wall as we are not using lower thirds for scripture/quote slides. Typically the reference (or person being quoted) is in a different font, size, or a line is placed below to make a distinction between the two sections.

## Reference Sides
The next slide is the Reference Sides slide. This on contains the reference only in a large font to be used when a scripture or quote is used.
