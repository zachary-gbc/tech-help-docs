1. If the input should be in stereo press the "ST" on the top right, if only one input, press the "M" on the top right
1. Press "CLOSE" on the top right to close the input selector
1. On the bottom left use the gain to set the input level, level should be turned up high enough to sound at a good level with the fader at unity (0)
