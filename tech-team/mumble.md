## Connection
Go to LAN Servers > Choose Lighting iMac > Input your name > Join

## Headset
- Currently the comms are one way communication only
- You can use earbuds, a headset, or headphones, whichever helps you hear best
- Please do not talk back during the service as the noise in the room is very loud for the director and all others listening


## Director
The director has a headset with a dock just in front of the multi view. This headset is already setup to be voice activated so it will start transmitting as soon as you start talking. There is a mute button on the mic itself and the mic on the dock will light up red when muted.
