# Photographer / Videographer Expectations

Responsible for:
- Getting pictures and/or video (as needed) for events/services/etc.
- Editing pictures and/or video prior to sending to BC staff for use

Special Notes:
- There will be limits on number of pictures we can use from an event, so when we ask for pictures from an event/service we will give a number that we need (for example 20) and we might only use a few of them (for example 10)
- If we need special types of pictures we will ask for them, but please use your expertise and experience to get us good shots, we wouldn't be asking you for pictures/videos unless we trusted what you give us
- Try to be as non-disruptive as possible
- If you don't have a silent mode on your camera you can use one of the ones GBC owns or you should limit your pictures to only a few or take them when there is a lot of other noise already to mask the shutter sound
- Pictures/video should only be taken at services when asked (or reach out to GBC staff before taking pictures) Some individuals are not ok with having their pictures taken and some events (such as kids events) we need to have all pictures and videos vetted by ministry leaders prior to use
- Please treat all pictures/video as private and do not share outside GBC staff
