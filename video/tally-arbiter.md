# Opening
Tally Arbiter is the program that we use for tally lights. Those are the lights on top of the cameras that say whether they are on preview or live. The system runs on the streaming computer.

You should only need to use this if the Tally lights are not working correctly.

Click on the green/red TA on the top bar to open.

Login using username *admin* and password *12345*.

# Settings
Once settings are open click Listeners on the top, that is the only tab you should need to edit.

The listeners are listed below and what camera they are attached to. The number at the end of the Type is the number attached to the orange M5 Stick

Click the dropdown to assign it to a new device.

# Troubleshooting
If you are still unable to get the Tally Lights to work then it may be the network causing the issue. This usually means the access points need rebooted.
