# Startup Checklist
{: .no_toc }
- Turn Computer On (if you don't see the login box try putting in the password and hitting enter or look at another screen to see if there is a login box there.)
- Turn on Confidence Monitors (remotes are stored next to the computer screen)
- Turn on Side TVs (one remote does both)
