# Opening
Restream is what we use to stream our services to YouTube and Facebook.

If asked to log in use the saved username/password.

Open the page by clicking here: [Restream Dashboard](https://app.restream.io/channel) or by clicking Restream on the bookmark dashboard in Safari on the Media Mac.

# Settings
Once open click Update Titles near the top right of the page.

Update the title for the upcoming service, the format should be "Groton Bible Chapel - Day". For example: "Groton Bible Chapel - January 1, 2025"

Once updated click Update All and then they should all show the updated title.

# Error Messages
If you see a message that says Facebook or YouTube is not connected please find Zachary or Jonny.
