# Common Issues and Fixes
- Board isn't working
  - Click MyDMX on the top left > preferences > Midi (on left of popup box) > check input and output for XTouch and Sparrow

- Bar lights aren't working
  - Bar lights are powered by the keys so if they keys are off the bar lights won't work; turn the keys on by flipping the switch underneath the keyboard
