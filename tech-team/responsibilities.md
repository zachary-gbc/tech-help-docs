# Tech Team Responsibilities and Expectations
While many of the responsibilities and expectations will change from position to position, there are many that will remain the same and should be core to what we do and how we do it here at GBC.

## Own Your Area
This means that when you are scheduled for an area, you are entrusted to do what needs to be done there. You should know how to run things and do basic troubleshooting. You are not expected to know every intricacy of that area, but you should have enough knowledge to be able to troubleshoot and fix minor issues as they arise and make the decision needed.

## Communicate
Everyone serving in GBC tech is working toward the same goal. So if you see or hear something that you think is incorrect say something. You should not feel intimidated to speak up. Sometimes a small change in one area will immensely help another area. For example adding light at a certain time may help cameras greatly while not diminishing the in-room experience.

## Speak Kindly
While this applies to every interaction notes here are for those coming with complaints. If someone outside the tech team comes to you to express their opinions of things regarding tech, hear them out, ask them where they were sitting when they experienced the thing they are talking about, and thank them for telling you. If appropriate make a change, but use your discretion and only make a change if it should be made. Please pass along any interaction you feel should be passed along as soon as appropriately possible.

## Be Timely
Practice times are listed in planning center services and you are only expected to come to the last one. Normally this is Saturday night for a Sunday morning service. There is also a run-through that you are expected to be at as well. The goal is to start as close to the start time listed as possible. That means if you need extra time to be ready you should plan to arrive early enough to do what you need to before the start time so we can start on time. You should learn how much time you need and plan accordingly.

## Dress Appropriately
This means appropriate for the occasion. For example those that are running cameras up front should be wearing something dark so as to not stand out. For an event such as a wedding or memorial service a nicer attire is expected. No hats should be worn in the sanctuary during services.

## Learn From and Teach Others
We should all be constantly learning to improve our areas of service and teaching others along the way. When you have a question about how something works ask. If the question comes at a busy time then make a note and ask it when things slow down. Help each other out when they have questions and teach others that donâ€™t know as much. Some folks are brand new to their area of service and some have been away for a while and might have forgotten things so be gracious and helpful to everyone serving with you. And if you would like to know more about your area ask for either specific or general training to learn more and improve your skills.
